# disease-drug-score
We create a graph using the free online databases DisGeNET and DGIdb. The user is able to execute the R code with one argument (disease name as found in the DisGeNET_xxxxxxxx.txt) in order to find out a sorted list of potential related drugs through the common disease-drug genes.
